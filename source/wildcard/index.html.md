# Wildcard

Wildcard is a platform that empowers anyone to build browser extensions and modify websites to meet their own specific needs, using a familiar spreadsheet view. It's a research project as part of my PhD at MIT, with my advisor Daniel Jackson.

Here's a 60 second demo of adding read times to Hacker News using a spreadsheet:

## Learn more

To learn more about Wildcard, you can read the paper presented at Convivial Computing Salon 2020, which has lots more demo videos and details:

Or watch this short 15 minute talk from Onward! 2020, which shows some more examples and explains some of the deeper ideas behind the project:
