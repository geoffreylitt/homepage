If you're an early career software engineer considering grad school, you're probably wondering: 1) is it a good idea? 2) how do I get in?

Unfortunately, in my experience, it's hard to find good advice on this rather niche question. There's lots of advice on grad school written by academics, but most of it seems to be for undergrads thinking about grad school from day 1 of freshman year. Conversely, most people in industry don't really know what grad school is like, so they can't give good advice either. I found all of this quite challenging a couple years ago when I was applying to PhD programs.

When I graduated from college, I had no plans of going to grad school. I got involved with an ed tech startup founded by some classmates, and ended up spending five years there as a software engineer. This was a really high-growth and fulfilling experience, but along the way I became deeply interested in programming tools and customizable software, to the point that I couldn't satisfy my main interests at my job. I considered multiple routes like starting a company, but ultimately decided I wanted to pursue a PhD. In the end, I applied to eight competitive programs and was accepted to six of them, and I'm now a happy second year PhD student at MIT CSAIL.

This is the guide I wish I had when I was applying. It's specifically targeted at people who have spent some time in industry and are wondering whether they should do a PhD, and how to get in. Keep in mind, as with most advice, this is all based on my n=1 personal experience, and I'm only a year into this whole endeavor, so you should carefully balance my thoughts here with other sources (some linked at the bottom of this post).

## why

- it's just a job
- know your motivation
- consider the pay cut

## how

- it's just a job application
- play up your competitive advantage
- do some research
