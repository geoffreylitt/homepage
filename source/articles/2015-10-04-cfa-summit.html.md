Last week I was lucky enough to attend the [2015 Code for America Summit](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/) with two of my coworkers, to accept an award for our work on the crowdsourced subway alerts app MBTA Ninja (which I've [written about before](http://geoffreylitt.com/2015/02/28/mbta-ninja.html) here).

Code for America is a nonprofit that's at the forefront of the civic tech movement, and their annual conference feels like a collection of all the most energetic and optimistic tech people from across the country gathered in one room. This was also their first year doing an awards program and I was impressed by [all of the winners](http://awards.codeforamerica.org/).

We saw many great presentations over the three days (you should check out [the videos](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/) next week), but a single talk stood out as totally changing the way I think about government tech.

The speaker was Todd Park, who led the "tech surge" that saved Healthcare.gov and now serves as a senior advisor to the President. Before his talk begins, I see him standing at the side of the Marriott conference room fidgeting with his iPhone. He looks a typically busy and stoically professional government employee.

But then, his introduction finishes, and *bam*, he sprints up to the podium with a beaming smile. This is not a leisurely politician-jog-up-the-stairs, but a real, Usain-Bolt-out-of-the-starting-blocks sprint. I swear I see him nearly trip over a cable in his excitement to get to the stage. "HELLO!!!" he shouts once he reaches the mic, arms wildly gesticulating. From the get go, it is very clear that this is not your typical "government tech guy." (I later found out that President Obama [has described](http://www.fastcompany.com/3046756/obama-and-his-geeks) Park as "the most enthusiastic guy I know", which is a pretty cool thing for the President to have said about you.)

Park launches into the story of how his small team of independent contractors fixed the Healthcare.gov login system. He starts by showing the stats for the login system that was originally built for the website by big contractors: "$200 million to build it, $70 million per year to operate it, response times above 5 seconds, a 25% error rate—can you even believe it!?" Each number is emphasized with a graphic on the slide showing just how amazed you should be at this shittiness. There is chuckling in the audience, heads shaking, mouths agape.

Many presentations at the conference start with a description of a tech debacle like this; other common themes include thousand-page-long PDFs and websites with business hours. The delivery is always calibrated for comedic effect, and the reactions remind me a bit of watching Jon Stewart—sometimes when faced with the reality of incompetent government, all we can do is laugh.

But whereas Stewart often leaves us to stew in our hopelessness, Code for America has no place for cynicism. Park goes on to explain that the login system was recently rewritten by a small team of programmers using modern, agile development techniques. This is another common refrain of nearly every talk at the conference. Talk to your users, design for them, iterate quickly—these techniques aren't just for lean Silicon Valley startups anymore. The virus is spreading in government, and it's working.

Park prepares to show us the new metrics post-rewrite, and the audience holds its breath. This is nerd suspense at its best. _Next slide_.

"$4 million to build. $1 million per year to operate. 30 millisecond response time...and an error rate of 0.000167%!" He reads the error rate with dramatic pauses: "zero point zero...zero...zero," each order of magnitude hammering another nail in the coffin of the shitty old way. 50 times cheaper, 100 times faster, and 150,000 times less error-prone—the numbers are staggering. _Cue applause_.

I leave the room feeling like I've just seen a Steve Jobs keynote reveal. Except that instead of a gadget, the One More Thing was a new login system for a government health insurance website. Crazy, right?

The story isn't an isolated incident either—Park and many others are working on replicating the success across the federal government, through the newly spun up [US Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) organizations.

The energy I felt in that presentation has made me excited about the future of technology in government. What matters in the end isn't the specific tech stack being used or the fact the government is now using Github and Slack. What matters is that there are people who _care_—who are able to do more with less, who are willing to bring their private sector experience to bear in service of government, and who can get up in front of a crowd and get them cheering about a new login system for a health insurance website.

Given the pervasiveness of technology today, the potential for this movement also extends well beyond making better websites. Just as Healthcare.gov imperiled the public's trust and reinforced an image of government as incompetent, good technology can do the opposite. At its best, well-designed and well-implemented tech shows that government is capable of delivering real value to us in the same way that Silicon Valley companies do every day—as well as in important ways that the private sector never could. And maybe, just maybe, that effect on perception will slowly shift the way that voters fundamentally think about government as an institution, and the role we want government to play in our lives.
