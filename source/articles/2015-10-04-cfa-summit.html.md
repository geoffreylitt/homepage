Last week, I was lucky enough to attend the 2015 Code for America Summit with two of my coworkers, to accept an award for our work on the crowdsourced subway alerts app MBTA Ninja (which I've [written about before](/2015/02/28/mbta-ninja.html)).

Code for America is an awesome nonprofit leading the way towards better tech in government, and each year they bring together people from local/federal government, nonprofits, and the technology world to share ideas. The vibe at the event feels like a mix of support group and religious congregation -- a refuge for forward-thinking government employees to commiserate with like-minded souls, but moreso a launching point to go forth and spread the gospel of tech and innovation in governments and cities across the country.

The best example I saw of the sheer energy present at the conference came not from a young techie type, but in a talk by Todd Park, the former CTO of the United States, who led the effort to save Healthcare.gov and now serves as a senior advisor to the President. Before his talk begins, I see Park standing at the side of the room fidgeting with his iPhone, a typical super-busy high level government employee.

But then, his introduction finishes, and *bam*, he sprints up to the podium. This is not just a President Obama-style jog up the stairs with arms swinging, but a real, honest-to-god, Usain Bolt out of the starting blocks, sprint. I swear I see him nearly trip over a cable in his excitement to get to the stage. "HELLO!" he shouts once he reaches the mic, arms wildly gesticulating. From the get go, everything about the presentation has been choreographed perfectly for its audience, portraying precisely the opposite of what you would expect from a tired old government tech guy.

Park launches into the story of how his small team of independent contractors fixed the Healthcare.gov login system. Nearly every presentation at the conference tells a miracle story with modern tech as the savior, and Park is a master of the form. First, as always: lambast the Shitty Old Way. He recites the stats for the login system that was originally built for the website: "$200m to build it, $70m per year to operate, a 25% error rate, insane downtime -- can you even believe it?" Each number is matched with a graphic on the slide showing just how amazed you should be at this shittiness. There is chuckling in the audience, heads shaking, mouths agape.

This "explain the problem" introduction is a standard part of any startup pitch, but the problems being described at the conference are so real and important that they usually pack a visceral punch. It taps into the same dark well of humor that Jon Stewart draws from: how can the government running our country be so terribly incompetent? When faced with this sad reality, the natural reaction is a weird mix of outrage, disgust, and laughter. Other frequent themes at the conference include thousand-page-long PDFs and terribly designed application forms using WordArt, and the reaction from the crowd is always the same.

Then comes the pivot. The Shitty Old Way is sitting there like a teeball, and you can tell Park is about to hit it out of the park. "We thought we could do better," he says, pulling up a new slide with different numbers on it. "Team of 10 people, $10m to build, $1m per year to operate...and an error rate of 0.000167%!" He emphasizes each zero in the new error rate number with a pause.



- modification here: the problems are real, we have to live with government, so people believe that things actually matter

- it's different from Jon Stewart because there is a solution

- structure question: comment during or after the story?

- teeball maybe not necessary

optimism is infectious! Show don't tell through the TP story
