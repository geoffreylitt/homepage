    I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at MIT in the [Software Design Group](http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/). My goal is to make programming radically more accessible, so that everyone can build and tweak their own software.

    Recently I've been focused on _data interoperability_: how can we build a world where you can [Bring Your Own Client](/2021/03/05/bring-your-own-client.html) and enable your software tools to work together?

    Some recent projects:

    * [Cambria](https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria.html): a system for ergonomic data schema compatibility, with the Ink and Switch research lab.
    * [Wildcard](/wildcard): a platform that empowers end users to modify web applications through a spreadsheet interface.
    * [Twemex](https://twemex.app): a browser extension that surfaces the best ideas on Twitter.

    Before coming to MIT, I was an early employee at [Panorama Education](https://www.panoramaed.com/) (YC S13), and helped grow it into a leading provider of thoughtful data analytics software for K-12 schools. I led design and development on many of our [reporting features](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/projects/free-response-analytics.html).
