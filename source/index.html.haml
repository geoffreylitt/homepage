    Welcome! I do research on [malleable software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/): computing environments where anyone can adapt their software to meet their needs with minimal friction. For more on what that means and why it matters, see [this essay](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/).

    I'm also working on AI-assisted programming these days. I believe AI can help usher in a [new era of personal software tools](/2023/03/25/llm-end-user-programming.html), help programmers [have more fun](/2024/12/22/making-programming-more-fun-with-an-ai-generated-debugger.html), and [create new interaction patterns](/2023/07/25/building-personal-tools-on-the-fly-with-llms.html) for working with software.

    I'm currently a senior researcher at the independent research lab [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/). Previously I received a PhD in computer science at MIT, advised by [Daniel Jackson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/). Earlier in my career I [worked](https://mubi.com/) at [startups](https://www.panoramaed.com/) doing engineering and design.

    You can reach me via [email](mailto:gklitt@gmail.com). I enjoy hearing from people making cool stuff! I also do a bit of startup advising and investing in companies related to my work.
