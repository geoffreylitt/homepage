    I'm researching ways to give people more agency in computing, so they can compose, tweak, and even build their own tools, even if they don't have programming skills. Some of my affiliations:

    - I'm a CS PhD student at MIT, in the [Software Design Group](http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/).
    - I regularly work with the industrial research lab [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/).
    - Previously, I helped build the edtech startup [Panorama Education](https://www.panoramaed.com/) (YC S13).

    These days, I'm thinking a lot about:

    - **gradual enrichment**: growing simple text documents into interactive applications, as in [Potluck](https://inkandswitch.com/potluck)
    - **AI in end-user programming**: how can LLMs help people customize software or create new tools? Some [preliminary thoughts](/2022/11/23/dynamic-documents.html)
    - **reactive UI**: simplifying UI development by deeply integrating UI with a fast relational database, in the [Riffle](https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude) project

    Let me know if you'd like to chat about any of those topics!
