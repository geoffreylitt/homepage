    Welcome! I work on *malleable software*: computing environments where anyone can adapt their software to meet their needs with minimal friction. To see what that means to me, read [this essay](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/) or listen to [this interview](https://jacksondahl.com/dialectic/geoffrey-litt).

    I'm also tinkering with AI-assisted programming, which I think can help usher in a [new era of personal software tools](/2023/03/25/llm-end-user-programming.html), help programmers [have more fun](/2024/12/22/making-programming-more-fun-with-an-ai-generated-debugger.html), and [create new interaction patterns](/2023/07/25/building-personal-tools-on-the-fly-with-llms.html) for working with software.

    I currently work at [Notion](https://www.notion.com/). Previously I was a senior researcher at the independent research lab [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/), and I did a PhD in HCI at MIT advised by [Daniel Jackson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/). Earlier in my career I did design and engineering at [startups](https://www.panoramaed.com/). My core skill is designing and prototyping environments for thinking.

    You can reach me via [email](mailto:gklitt@gmail.com). I enjoy hearing from people making cool stuff! I also do a bit of startup advising for companies related to my work.
