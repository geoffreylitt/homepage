    I'm researching ways to give people more agency in computing, so they can tweak or create their own tools, even if they don't have programming skills.

    I'm currently a senior researcher at the independent research lab [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/), leading the Malleable Software research track.

    Previously, I completed a PhD at MIT CSAIL in the [Software Design Group](http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/) advised by [Daniel Jackson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/). Before that, I spent five years as an early engineer and designer building the edtech startup [Panorama Education](https://www.panoramaed.com/) (YC S13).

    These days, I'm thinking a lot about **AI + malleable software**: How can LLMs help people make custom software?
