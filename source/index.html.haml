    My professional mission is to bring into the world _malleable software_: computing environments where anyone can mold their tools to their own unique needs.

    (For more background on what that mission means and why it matters to me, check out my [interview on the Metamuse podcast](https://museapp.com/podcast/34-bring-your-own-client/).)

    I'm currently a senior researcher at the independent research lab [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/), leading the malleable software research track.

    Before that, I completed a PhD at MIT CSAIL in the [Software Design Group](http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/) advised by [Daniel Jackson](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/). Before *that*, I spent five years as an early engineer and designer building the edtech startup [Panorama Education](https://www.panoramaed.com/) (YC S13).

    These days, I'm thinking a lot about **AI + malleable software**: How can LLMs help people make their own custom software?

    *Essay:* [Malleable software in the age of LLMs](/2023/03/25/llm-end-user-programming.html)

    *Talk:* [Dynamic documents as personal software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ3i4K3hefI)
