# 🐞 ladybug

ladybug is a visual debugger for Ruby web applications that uses
Chrome Devtools as a user interface.

It aims to provide a rich backend debugging experience in a UI that many
web developers are already familiar with for debugging frontend Javascript.

To implement it, I wrote a custom debugging server for Ruby
that speaks the Chrome DevTools wire protocol.
