# About

Hi there! I'm a software engineer who is passionate about the power of data and machine learning to achieve social good. I'm currently working at [Panorama Education](http://www.panoramaed.com), where we're building the future of data analytics for thousands of K-12 schools around the world.

I previously worked for the film startup [MUBI.com](http://mubi.com), and have been on first-place winning teams at hackathons like YHack, HackNY, and the NYU Abu Dhabi International Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World.

Outside of web technologies, I've done fun projects like build faster NoSQL document support into PostgreSQL, create a sonar-based wall-tracking system for a quadcopter, and work on [code that runs a hybrid racecar](https://github.com/BulldogsRacing/Yale-Formula-Hybrid).

In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello and running.

You can find me on [Github](http://www.github.com/geoffreylitt), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/geoffreylitt), and [email](mailto:gklitt@gmail.com). Don't hesitate to reach out if I might be able to help you in any way!

These are a few projects I've done alone or in small teams.

* [**Postgres-BSON**](/files/Postgres-BSON.pdf) - We replaced the PostgreSQL JSON storage backend with [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/) (MongoDB's JSON alternative with faster traversal). This increased performance up to 8 times on some queries.
