# About

I'm interested in the past and future of tools for thinking and programming, inspired by the work of [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/), [Alan Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY&feature=youtu.be), [Chris Granger](http://www.chris-granger.com/2014/03/27/toward-a-better-programming/), and others.

For the past few years I've worked at [Panorama Education](http://www.panoramaed.com), where we help K-12 schools use data to better support their students and communities. As one example, I led a team that built [a tool](https://blog.panoramaed.com/introducing-free-response-analytics/) that uses modern NLP techniques to help principals sift through text feedback about the school from students and parents.

You can find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/geoffreylitt) and [email](mailto:gklitt@gmail.com). Please reach out if I might be able to help you in any way.
