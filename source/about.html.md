# About

Hi there! I'm a software engineer trying to help nudge computing towards being a force for real, thoughtful progress for humanity.

For the past few years I've worked at [Panorama Education](http://www.panoramaed.com), where we help K-12 schools use data to better support their students and communities. As one example, I led a team that built [a tool](https://blog.panoramaed.com/introducing-free-response-analytics/) that uses modern NLP techniques to help principals sift through text feedback about the school from students and parents.

I'm also interested in the past and future of tools for programming, inspired by the work of [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/), [Alan Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY&feature=youtu.be), [Chris Granger](http://www.chris-granger.com/2014/03/27/toward-a-better-programming/), and others.

I've worked on fun projects like building faster NoSQL document support into PostgreSQL, creating a sonar-based wall-tracking system for a quadcopter, and work on [code that runs a hybrid racecar](https://github.com/BulldogsRacing/Yale-Formula-Hybrid).

In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello and running.

You can find me on [Github](http://www.github.com/geoffreylitt), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/geoffreylitt), and [email](mailto:gklitt@gmail.com). Don't hesitate to reach out if I might be able to help you in any way!
