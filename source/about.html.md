# About

Hi there! I'm a programmer, designer, and musician with interests in product design and data analysis. I work at [Panorama Education](http://www.panoramaed.com), building the future of school data analytics and feedback surveys for K-12 schools.

In the past I've worked for [MUBI.com](http://mubi.com) and the Yale Law Library. I've also been on winning teams at hackathons like YHack, HackNY, and the NYU Abu Dhabi International Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World.

Outside of web technologies, I've done fun stuff like build faster NoSQL document support into PostgreSQL, create a sonar-based wall-tracking system for a quadcopter, and work on [code that runs a hybrid racecar](https://github.com/BulldogsRacing/Yale-Formula-Hybrid).

In my free time, I enjoy running and playing the cello. In college, I was in the all-cello rock group [Low Strung](http://lowstrungcellos.org).

You can find me on [Github](http://www.github.com/geoffreylitt), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/geoffreylitt), and [email](mailto:gklitt@gmail.com).

#Projects

These are a few projects I've done alone or in small teams -- for hackathons, school, work, and fun!

* [**MBTA Ninja**](http://mbta.ninja) - Waze for the Boston subway
* [**Postgres-BSON**](/files/Postgres-BSON.pdf) - We replaced the PostgreSQL JSON storage backend with [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/) (MongoDB's JSON alternative with faster traversal). This increased performance up to 8 times on some queries! Working towards an open source release.
* **Yale Classroulette** - beautiful, randomized college course search (site taken down by Yale for copyright reasons)
* [**gitdown**](http://www.alexq.in/gitdown/) - an Arduino breathalyzer that stops you from programming drunk (HackNY)
* [**LZW**](http://github.com/geoffreylitt/lzw) - an implementation of the LZW compression algorithm in C.
* [**DenebRe.com**](http://denebre.com) - brand, logo and website design for a Japanese solar power company
* [**Sendquest.in**](http://sendquest.in) - easy mass polling via SMS (Yale Hackathon 2012)
* [**TakeFlight**](http://takeflight.herokuapp.com/) - connecting Arab students with mentors and hosting video mentoring sessions (NYUAD Hackathon 2013)
