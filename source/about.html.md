# About

Hi there! I'm a programmer and designer, currently majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Yale University. 

I enjoy designing and building beautiful web applications, mostly using Ruby on Rails. I'm currently participating in Y Combinator Summer 2013 with [Panorama Education](http://www.panoramaed.com), helping design the future of school data analytics for K-12 schools.

In the past I've done web development for [MUBI.com](http://mubi.com) and the Yale Law Library. I've also been on winning teams at hackathons like [HackNY](http://www.alexq.in/gitdown/) and the [NYU Abu Dhabi International Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World](https://github.com/geoffreylitt/mentorme).

Outside of web technologies, I've done fun stuff like build faster NoSQL document support into PostgreSQL, create a sonar-based wall-tracking system for a quadcopter, and develop [code that runs a hybrid racecar](https://github.com/BulldogsRacing/Yale-Formula-Hybrid).

In my free time, I enjoy running and playing the cello with my all-cello rock group [Low Strung](http://lowstrungcellos.org).

## Technologies

**My favorite languages**: Ruby, C, Javascript, HTML5/CSS

**Other languages I've used**: Python, Java, C++, Scheme, PHP

**Technologies I use**: Ruby on Rails, git, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, UNIX utilities

# Projects

Here are some of the personal projects I've worked on -- for school, hackathons, and just for kicks.

    This is a more substantive explanation of what Yale Classroulette is. It's a tool that enables Yale students to discover classes that they should be interested in.
