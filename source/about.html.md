# About

## Currently...

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at MIT, in the [Software Design Group](https://sdg.csail.mit.edu/).

I'm thinking about:

**Futuristic programming languages, environments, debuggers**: How can we co-design languages and environments that give programmers more feedback and visibility into what they're doing? My [Margin Notes](/margin-notes) project explored one way to use runtime traces to help programmers understand the data flowing through their programs.

**Making programming more accessible**: (aka no-code development, end-user programming): how can we open up the full power of computing to more people, without the current barriers of programming? I'm currently exploring ways to use spreadsheets to build GUI apps.

**Tools for thought**: How can we design tools that use computers to augment human intelligence, rather than trying to replace it with artificial intelligence?

## Before that...

From 2013 to 2019, I was an early engineer at [Panorama Education](http://www.panoramaed.com) (YC S13), a startup helping K-12 educators use data to better understand their students and schools. I wore various hats across engineering, product, and design, and helped grow Panorama into a leading education platform used by over 9 million students across the country. Here's a [sample project](/projects/free-response-analytics.html) I worked on to categorize text responses to school feedback surveys.

From 2010 to 2014, I got my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Yale University, where I played in the all-cello rock band Low Strung.

I grew up in Tokyo, Japan (日本語話せます!) and the Washington, DC area.
