# About

Hi there! I'm a software engineer and designer, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Yale University (Class of 2014).

I enjoy creating complex web applications with simple interfaces. I'm currently working at [Panorama Education (YC S13)](http://www.panoramaed.com), building the future of school data analytics for K-12 schools.

In the past I've written code for [MUBI.com](http://mubi.com) and the Yale Law Library. I've also been on winning teams at hackathons like [HackNY](http://www.alexq.in/gitdown/) and the [NYU Abu Dhabi International Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World](https://github.com/geoffreylitt/mentorme).

Outside of web technologies, I've done fun stuff like build faster NoSQL document support into PostgreSQL, create a sonar-based wall-tracking system for a quadcopter, and develop [code that runs a hybrid racecar](https://github.com/BulldogsRacing/Yale-Formula-Hybrid).

In my free time, I enjoy running and playing the cello with my all-cello rock group [Low Strung](http://lowstrungcellos.org).

## Technologies

**My favorite languages**: Ruby, C, Javascript, HTML5/CSS

**Other languages I've used**: Python, Java, C++, Scheme, PHP

**Technologies I use**: Ruby on Rails, git, Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, UNIX utilities

#Projects
<a name="projects"></a>

These are a few projects I've done alone or in small teams -- for hackathons, school, work, and fun!

* [**Yale Classroulette**](http://yaleclassroulette.com) - beautiful, randomized college course search
* [**Postgres-BSON**](/files/Postgres-BSON.pdf) - We replaced the PostgreSQL JSON storage backend with [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/) (MongoDB's JSON alternative with faster traversal). This increased performance up to 8 times on some queries! Working towards an open source release.
* [**gitdown**](http://www.alexq.in/gitdown/) - an Arduino breathalyzer that stops you from programming drunk (HackNY)
* [**LZW**](http://github.com/geoffreylitt/lzw) - an implementation of the LZW compression algorithm in C.
* [**DenebRe.com**](http://denebre.com) - brand, logo and website design for a Japanese solar power company
* [**Sendquest.in**](http://sendquest.in) - easy mass polling via SMS (Yale Hackathon 2012)
* [**TakeFlight**](http://takeflight.herokuapp.com/) - connecting Arab students with mentors and hosting video mentoring sessions (NYUAD Hackathon 2013)
