# About

Hi there! I'm a software engineer trying to help nudge computing towards being a force for real, thoughtful progress for humanity.

For the past few years I've worked at [Panorama Education](http://www.panoramaed.com), where we help K-12 schools use data to better support their students and communities. As one example, I led a team that built [a tool](https://blog.panoramaed.com/introducing-free-response-analytics/) that uses modern NLP techniques to help principals sift through text feedback about the school from students and parents.

I'm also interested in the past and future of tools for programming, inspired by the work of [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/), [Alan Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY&feature=youtu.be), [Chris Granger](http://www.chris-granger.com/2014/03/27/toward-a-better-programming/), and others.

I've worked on fun projects like building faster NoSQL document support into PostgreSQL, creating a sonar-based wall-tracking system for a quadcopter, and work on [code that runs a hybrid racecar](https://github.com/BulldogsRacing/Yale-Formula-Hybrid).

In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello and running.

You can find me on [Github](http://www.github.com/geoffreylitt), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/geoffreylitt), and [email](mailto:gklitt@gmail.com). Don't hesitate to reach out if I might be able to help you in any way!

#Projects
<a name="projects"></a>

These are a few projects I've done alone or in small teams.

* [**MBTA Ninja**](http://mbta.ninja) - Waze for the Boston subway ([press coverage](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/02/26/commuters-use-mbta-ninja-help-other-riders/), [my post about it](/2015/02/28/mbta-ninja.html))
* [**Postgres-BSON**](/files/Postgres-BSON.pdf) - We replaced the PostgreSQL JSON storage backend with [BSON](http://bsonspec.org/) (MongoDB's JSON alternative with faster traversal). This increased performance up to 8 times on some queries.
* **Yale Classroulette** - beautiful, randomized college course search ([press coverage](http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/08/08/class-roulette-aims-to-mimic-bluebooking/))
* [**gitdown**](http://www.alexq.in/gitdown/) - an Arduino breathalyzer that stops you from programming drunk (HackNY Spring 2013, 1st place)
* [**LZW**](http://github.com/geoffreylitt/lzw) - an implementation of the LZW compression algorithm in C.
* **TakeFlight** - connecting Arab students with mentors and hosting video mentoring sessions (NYUAD Hackathon 2013, 1st place)
