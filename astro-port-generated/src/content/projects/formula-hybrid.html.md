# Bulldogs Racing

The Yale Bulldogs Racing team built a gas-electric hybrid racecar
that [won first place](https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/bulldogs-racing-roars-big-win) at the 2013 Formula Hybrid International competition.

I worked on low-voltage electronics, and wrote large portions of the code for the Arduino microcontroller ([Github link](https://github.com/BulldogsRacing/Yale-Formula-Hybrid)) that handled functions like:

* core driving functions: mapping the gas pedal to the throttle, activating the brake light
* displaying data to the driver on a control panel
* managing a power-saving "endurance mode"
* monitoring the high voltage battery system
* wirelessly sending telemetry data
* safety cutoffs in dangerous situations
