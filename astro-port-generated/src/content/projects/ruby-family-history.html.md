# Ruby: A Family History

I think the Ruby programming language beautifully
combines some of the best ideas from LISP, Smalltalk, and Perl,
and I've noticed many Ruby programmers aren't aware of the heritage of those ideas.

So I gave a talk to explain some of the history behind Ruby at **RailsConf 2018**!

## Video

Here's a videoâ€”unfortunately the recording of me didn't work so
it's just the slides with my voiceover.
